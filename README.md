# Election_Analysis

## Overview
This script is designed to take the election results from three counties and calculate the winner, and a few other statistics to go along with it such as percentage votes, votes per county, and how much representation each county has. These results are printed in the terminal and also printed in a text document in the analysis folder.

## Results

The election results above are displayed in the terminal when running the code and also displayed in the txt file. 

## Adaptability

This script was used to compute the results for this election and has the ability to compute the results of elections with any configuration of candidates and counties. When used on larger datasets with more counties and candidates it may be better for the script not to print in the terminal, and that is easily done with small adjustment. 

Along with that one issue you may run into with larger elections is there may be so many candidates that the results may get slightly messy when they are all listed; especially with some elections allowing you to have an open input box. With small adjustment you would also be able to have it only display the most prominent results in either the terminal or the text file, and then list all the results in a seperate location. This would make the results more clear and to the point for the end user. 

## Deeper Analysis with the script

When it comes to deeper analysis with this script it would be possible to also have the script compute the candidate that is the most popular in each county and even display that on a map. This could become very useful in large elections with many counties, and would also give the ability to pull demographic information from the election results that could be processed with other data.
